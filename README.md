# Backend

## Introduction

This project is designed for the identification of contours, crops, and crop yield of land plots.

## Key Features

- Identification of contours, crops, and crop yield.
- Downloading of satellite images using sentinel2_downloader.
- Calculation of indices for contours using satellite images.
- Determination of the elevation above sea level in Kyrgyzstan using elevation-Kyrgyzstan.
- Management of data by regions, districts, and land plots.
- Reporting.

## Technologies

- Django: The primary web application framework.
- Python3.10: The main programming language.
- GDAL: A library for processing geospatial data.
- Docker/Docker Compose: For containerizing the application and its dependencies.
- PyTorch/YOLOv8: For training and applying machine learning models for the identification of contours, crops, and crop
  yield.
- sentinel2_downloader: For downloading satellite images.
- elevation-Kyrgyzstan: For determining the elevation above sea level in Kyrgyzstan.
