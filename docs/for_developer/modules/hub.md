### 📄 [/hub/views/authetificated.py](/hub/views/authetificated.py)

## LoginHubView

### Purpose

The `LoginHubView` API view is designed to handle user login and return an authentication token. It allows clients to send POST requests with user credentials for authentication. Upon successful authentication, the view returns a JSON response containing the authentication token and relevant user details.

### Description

- *POST Request Handling*:
  - The view handles HTTP POST requests for user authentication.
  - It expects the client to provide user credentials (username and password) in the request body.
  - The request data is serialized and validated using the `LoginSerializer`.

- *User Authentication*:
  - The `authenticate` method from Django is used to verify the user's credentials based on the provided username and password.
  - If the provided credentials are valid, it returns the corresponding user object; otherwise, it returns `None`.

- *Authentication Token*:
  - If the user's credentials are valid (i.e., `user` is not `None`), the view generates or fetches an authentication token for the user.
  - The authentication token is a unique identifier associated with the user and can be used for subsequent authenticated requests.

- *Response*:
  - Upon successful authentication, the view returns a JSON response with the following data:
    - `'token'`: The authentication token key.
    - `'user_id'`: The user's unique identifier.
    - `'email'`: The user's email (assuming the 'username' field stores the email).
    - `'is_superuser'`: A boolean indicating whether the user is a superuser.
    - `'is_active'`: A boolean indicating whether the user is active.

- *Validation and Exception Handling*:
  - The view uses the `LoginSerializer` to serialize and validate the request data.
  - If the data is not valid, a validation exception is raised, indicating the validation error.
  - If the provided credentials are invalid, an authentication exception is raised.

### Usage

Clients can send POST requests to the `/login/` endpoint of the API with valid user credentials to authenticate. Upon successful authentication, the client receives an authentication token that can be used for subsequent authenticated requests.

### Security Considerations

## ElevationSoilAPIView

### Purpose

The `ElevationSoilAPIView` is an API view designed to handle GET requests for retrieving elevation and soil data based on a given geographical point (latitude and longitude). It combines both soil data retrieved from a database and elevation data obtained from an external source.

### Description

- *GET Request Handling*:
  - The view handles HTTP GET requests to fetch elevation and soil data.
  - It expects the client to provide `latitude` and `longitude` parameters as part of the query string in the request URL.

- *Parameters*:
  - `latitude` (float): The latitude of the geographical point for which data is requested.
  - `longitude` (float): The longitude of the geographical point for which data is requested.

- *Soil Data Query*:
  - The view establishes a connection to the database and executes a SQL query to fetch soil data based on the provided geographical point.
  - It checks if both `latitude` and `longitude` are provided and within the database's extent.
  - The query returns soil data for the specified point, including soil ID and name.

- *Elevation Data*:
  - The view also retrieves elevation data using an external function (`elevation`) based on the given geographical point.

- *Response*:
  - The view returns a JSON response containing elevation and soil data, if available.
  - The response includes:
    - `'soil'`: Soil data, including ID and name (if available).
    - `'elevation'`: Elevation data based on the provided geographical point.

- *Error Handling*:
  - If either `latitude` or `longitude` is missing in the request, the view returns a 400 Bad Request response with an error message.
  - If any exceptions occur during the process, an `APIException` is raised, and the error message is included in the response.

### Usage

Clients can send GET requests to the `/elevation-soil/` endpoint of the API with valid `latitude` and `longitude` parameters to retrieve elevation and soil data for a specific geographical point.

### Responses

- *Successful Response*:
  - Status Code: 200 OK
  - Content:
    json
    {
        "soil": {
            "id_soil": 1,
            "name": "Sandy Soil"
        },
        "elevation": 123.45
    }
    

- *Error Response (Missing Parameters)*:
  - Status Code: 400 Bad Request
  - Content:
    json
    {
        "message": "parameter 'latitude and longitude' is required"
    }
    

- *Error Response (Exception)*:
  - Status Code: 500 Internal Server Error
  - Content:
    json
    {
        "message": "An error occurred while fetching data"
    }
    

This API view provides a convenient way to obtain elevation and soil data for a specific geographical point by combining database queries and external data sources.

The `land_info.py` module handles operations related to the `LandInfo` model in the Django project. It provides API endpoints for performing CRUD operations on `LandInfo` objects and searching for `LandInfo` objects based on the `ink_code` field.

### Classes

#### 1. `LandInfoViewSet`

- *Purpose*: Provides CRUD operations for `LandInfo` objects.

- *Attributes*:
  - `queryset`: Retrieves all the `LandInfo` objects from the database.
  - `serializer_class`: Specifies the serializer used to handle `LandInfo` instances during API operations.
  - `lookup_field`: Defines the field used to look up a specific `LandInfo` object.

#### 2. `LandInfoSearch`

- *Purpose*: Handles the search functionality for `LandInfo` objects based on the `ink_code` field.

- *Methods*:
  - `get`: Processes GET requests for searching `LandInfo` objects based on the `ink_code` field.
    - If a search term is provided as a query parameter (`search`), it filters `LandInfo` objects whose `ink_code` contains the search term (case-insensitive).
    - Returns a JSON response containing a list of matching `ink_code` values.

### Usage

Clients can interact with the `LandInfo` objects through the following API endpoints:

- `GET /api/land-info/`: Retrieve a list of all `LandInfo` objects.
- `POST /api/land-info/`: Create a new `LandInfo` object.
- `GET /api/land-info/{ink_code}/`: Retrieve a specific `LandInfo` object by its `ink_code`.
- `PUT /api/land-info/{ink_code}/`: Update a specific `LandInfo` object by its `ink_code`.
- `PATCH /api/land-info/{ink_code}/`: Partially update a specific `LandInfo` object by its `ink_code`.
- `DELETE /api/land-info/{ink_code}/`: Delete a specific `LandInfo` object by its `ink_code`.

- `GET /api/land-info/search/`: Search for `LandInfo` objects based on the `ink_code` field. Use the `search` query parameter to specify the search term.

### Responses

- *Successful Response (GET /api/land-info/search/?search=term)*:
  - Status Code: 200 OK
  - Content:
    json
    {
        "list_ink_code": ["ink_code1", "ink_code2", ...]
    }
    

- *Empty Response (GET /api/land-info/search/)*:
  - Status Code: 200 OK
  - Content: `[]`

- *Error Response (GET /api/land-info/search/ without search term)*:
  - Status Code: 200 OK
  - Content: `[]`

### Notes

- The `LandInfoCustomSearchSerializer` is used to serialize the list of matching `ink_code` values in the search response.

This module provides endpoints for managing and searching `LandInfo` objects, enhancing the functionality of the Django project.
