## [üìÑ **asgi.py**](/config/asgi.py)

- **Django ASGI (asgi.py) Script**

  - **Description**: The `asgi.py` script is a Python script used in Django web applications to provide an entry point for handling asynchronous web requests using the ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) specification. ASGI allows Django to handle asynchronous operations, such as WebSockets, long-polling, and other real-time functionality, in addition to traditional synchronous HTTP requests.

  - **Import Statements**:
    - `os`: The `os` module is imported to work with operating system-related functionality.
    - `django.core.asgi.get_asgi_application`: The `get_asgi_application` function from Django's ASGI module is imported. It's used to retrieve the ASGI application for the Django project.

  - **Environment Configuration**:
    - `os.environ.setdefault("DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE", "config.settings")`: This line sets the default Django settings module for the application. It specifies the Python path to the settings module, allowing Django to configure the application based on the specified settings.

  - **ASGI Application Initialization**:
    - `application = get_asgi_application()`: This line initializes the ASGI application by calling the `get_asgi_application` function. It retrieves the ASGI application instance based on the project's settings.

  - **Usage**:
    - The `asgi.py` script serves as the entry point for handling asynchronous requests in a Django application. It's essential when enabling real-time functionality, such as WebSockets or handling long-polling requests.
    - ASGI support in Django enables the application to handle both traditional synchronous HTTP requests and asynchronous operations, making it suitable for modern, interactive web applications.

  - **Note**:
    - ASGI is particularly useful for applications that require real-time features, as it allows Django to work seamlessly with asynchronous frameworks and protocols.

- **Example**:
  - Here's an example of a simple `asgi.py` script in a Django project:

    ```python
    import os
    from django.core.asgi import get_asgi_application

    os.environ.setdefault("DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE", "config.settings")

    application = get_asgi_application()
    ```

  - This script sets up the ASGI application for the Django project, making it ready to handle both synchronous and asynchronous requests.

    - `MEDIA_URL` and `MEDIA_ROOT`: Define the URL and root directory for handling media files (user uploads).

  - **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) Settings**:
    - `CORS_ALLOW_ALL_ORIGINS`: Allows all origins to make cross-origin requests to the application.

  - **Leaflet Map Configuration**:
    - `LEAFLET_CONFIG`: Configures the Leaflet map with default settings.

  - **REST Framework Settings**:
    - `REST_FRAMEWORK`: Configures settings for the Django REST framework, including authentication and filtering options.

  - **Jazzmin Settings**:
    - `JAZZMIN_SETTINGS` and `JAZZMIN_UI_TWEAKS`: Define settings for the Jazzmin admin panel, including its appearance and customization options.

  - **Apache Kafka Configuration**:
    - `KAFKA_HOST_PORT`: Specifies the hostname and port for connecting to an Apache Kafka server.

  - **Usage**:
    - The `settings.py` file is a central configuration file for Django projects. It allows developers to customize the behavior of the application, including database connections, security settings, internationalization, and more.
  
  - **Note**:
    - Sensitive information such as `SECRET_KEY` and database credentials should be stored securely and not hard-coded in the file. Environment variables or dedicated configuration files are recommended for such sensitive data.

- **Example**:
  - The provided `settings.py` file is an example configuration for a Django application. It demonstrates various settings and configurations commonly used in Django projects.

## [üìÑ **urls.py**](/config/urls.py)

- **Django URL Configuration (urls.py)**

  - **Description**: The `urls.py` file is used to define the URL patterns for routing incoming HTTP requests to view functions in a Django application. It also includes configurations for internationalization, API documentation, and serving media and static files during development.

  - **URL Patterns**:
    - `path("i18n/", include("django.conf.urls.i18n"))`: Includes URL patterns for internationalization and language switching.

  - **Internationalization Patterns**:
    - `i18n_patterns`: Wraps the admin URLs with internationalization patterns for language selection.

  - **Serving Media and Static Files**:
    - If `DEBUG` is `True` (indicating a development environment), the application serves media and static files:
      - `urlpatterns += static(settings.MEDIA_URL, document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT)`: Serves media files (e.g., user uploads).
      - `urlpatterns += static(settings.STATIC_URL, document_root=settings.STATIC_ROOT)`: Serves static files (e.g., CSS, JavaScript) from the specified root directory.

  - **Admin Site Customization**:
    - `admin.site.site_header`: Customizes the header text of the Django admin site.
    - `admin.site.index_title`: Sets the title for the admin index page.

## [üìÑ **wsgi.py**](/config/wsgi.py)

- **Django WSGI Configuration (wsgi.py)**

  - **Description**: The `wsgi.py` file is used to configure and initialize the WSGI application for serving a Django web application using WSGI-compliant web servers such as Apache, Nginx, or Gunicorn.

  - **Import Statements**:
    - `import os`: Importing the `os` module for working with environment variables.
    - `from django.core.wsgi import get_wsgi_application`: Importing the `get_wsgi_application` function from Django's WSGI module.

  - **Environment Configuration**:
    - `os.environ.setdefault("DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE", "config.settings")`: Setting the default Django settings module to `"config.settings"` using the `os.environ.setdefault` method. This ensures that Django uses the specified settings module when initializing the application.

  - **WSGI Application Initialization**:
    - `application = get_wsgi_application()`: Initializing the WSGI application using the `get_wsgi_application` function from Django's WSGI module. This line creates the WSGI application instance that will handle incoming HTTP requests and route them to the appropriate views and handlers defined in the Django application.
